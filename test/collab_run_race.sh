# Regression test for the edit-then-run clobber race (collab audit HIGH-1).
#
# The documented agent workflow is "edit the .jl, then `pluto-collab run --stale`". The background
# file watcher only syncs the in-memory notebook after a ~0.4s debounce, so an edit-then-IMMEDIATELY
# -run used to race it: the server ran the OLD in-memory cells and (because the run also saves) wrote
# them straight back over the just-written file — silently losing the edit. serve_api_run now syncs
# from disk BEFORE choosing the stale set, closing the window.
#
# This mirrors collab_acceptance.sh but DELIBERATELY OMITS the sleep between the edit and the run —
# that sleep is exactly what masked this bug in the acceptance test.
#
# Usage: bash test/collab_run_race.sh    (needs julia --project=this, curl, sed)
