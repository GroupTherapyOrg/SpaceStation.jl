# Local multi-workspace: the hub server spawns ONE child SpaceStation server per local workspace folder
# (its own OS process, own port, own secret), each opened in its own browser tab. This is the SSH-remote
# model (see CollabRemote.jl) MINUS the SSH hop and tunnel — everything is already local: julia and the
# project are here, there's no bootstrap/install, and the browser reaches the child on 127.0.0.1 directly.
#
# The point: each child is a vanilla `SpaceStation.run(workspace=…)` — an individual server behaves exactly
# like Pluto always has. ALL the multi-workspace orchestration lives out here in the wrapper, never inside
# Pluto. (Per-port cookie scoping — see Authentication.jl — lets the hub and every child coexist in the
# browser, each with its own secret.)
#
# Lifecycle (chosen): closing a workspace TAB leaves its child running, so reopening from the launcher
# reattaches instantly with notebooks still alive (matched by the "workspace" field every server writes
# into its connection file). An explicit "shut down this workspace" stops one child; quitting the hub
# reaps them all — local processes aren't meant to outlive the app that launched them.
