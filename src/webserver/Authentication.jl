"""
The name of the auth cookie, scoped by the port the browser used to reach this server.

Cookies are scoped by host + name + path — **the port is not part of a cookie's scope**
(RFC 6265). So multiple Pluto servers on the same host (e.g. several `spacestation` workspaces
on `localhost:1234`, `:1235`, …) would all set a cookie named `secret` for `localhost` and
*clobber each other*: launching a second server logs the first one out of its own browser tab,
turning every cookie-authenticated request (`./api/v1/notebooks`, `./edit?id=…`, the editor
WebSocket) into a 403. Putting the port in the cookie *name* gives each server its own cookie.

The port has to be the one the BROWSER dialled, not the one we bound. An SSH tunnel decouples the
two — `ssh -L 45200:127.0.0.1:1234` means the browser says `localhost:45200` while the server
believes it is on `1234` — and every SpaceStation binds `port_hint = 1234` by default, so a local
hub and every remote node all claimed the name `pluto_secret_1234` on `localhost` and clobbered
each other. Opening a second workspace 403'd the first; refreshing the first 403'd the second.
Naming from `Host` restores the intent: one cookie per address the browser can actually name.

    origin_matches_host(request) -> Bool

Cross-origin defense for requests that carry ambient credentials (the secret cookie).

`SameSite=Strict` is NOT enough on its own here: a cookie's scope is host + name + path —
**the port is not part of it** — and browsers treat every `localhost:<port>` as the *same site*.
So a page served from any *other* local port (a second dev server, a docs preview, a compromised
dependency's dev server) is same-site with this one, and the browser will happily attach our
`pluto_secret_<port>` cookie to a request it initiates at us. That turns two of the fork's
additions into remote code execution: the `/terminal` WebSocket (an interactive shell) and the
`POST /api/v1/file/*` endpoints (arbitrary-path file writes).

The robust signal a browser cannot forge from another origin is the `Origin` header: it always
reflects the page that initiated the request, and script cannot set it. So:

  • No `Origin` header → allow. Non-browser clients (the `pluto-collab` CLI, `curl`, native
    WebSocket libraries) don't send one, and they are not a CSRF vector — they must still present
    the secret. A browser NEVER omits `Origin` on a WebSocket handshake or a cross-origin fetch.
  • `Origin` present → its authority (host:port) must equal the request's `Host`. The legitimate
    same-origin frontend always matches; a cross-origin attacker page never can.

Fails closed (unparseable Origin, or absent Host → reject). This is a backstop that holds even
in the dangerous `require_secret_for_access=false` Binder config, where the same-origin frontend
still matches but any attacker origin is refused.
