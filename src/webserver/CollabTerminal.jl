###
# The SpaceStation integrated terminal: a WebSocket ⇄ PTY bridge with PERSISTENT sessions.
#
# A client connects a websocket to `/terminal?tid=<id>` (authenticated with the normal
# Pluto secret — cookie or ?secret=…). The shell session belongs to the `tid`, not the
# socket: disconnecting (page refresh, network blip) leaves the shell running; the next
# connection with the same tid replays recent scrollback and reattaches — tmux semantics
# without tmux. Several sockets may attach to one tid (mirrored terminals).
#
# Wire protocol (deliberately trivial, no parser needed on either side):
#   client → server (text frames):   "0:<raw input>"      keystrokes for the shell
#                                    "1:<rows>,<cols>"     terminal was resized
#                                    "2:<ext>:<base64>"    a pasted image (see _handle_paste)
#   server → client (binary frames): raw PTY output bytes  (feed straight to xterm.js)
#
# Shells end when they exit (or the server stops). The scrollback ring holds the last
# $(TERMINAL_SCROLLBACK_LIMIT) bytes for replay on reattach.
